# Preface

The world is full of motion, light, sound, heat, and invisible forces—and in your pocket is a scientific instrument powerful enough to explore them all. This book is about curiosity, creativity, and using everyday technology to uncover the hidden rules of the universe. Whether you're a student, a teacher, or an independent learner, the following pages will help you turn your smartphone into a physics lab.

Before we dive into the experiments, take a moment to read the next few sections. They’ll introduce the project, how to get the most out of it, and how to stay safe while exploring.
