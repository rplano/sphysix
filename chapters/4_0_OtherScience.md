# Part IV: Interdisciplinary Sciences

While physics provides the foundation for understanding the natural world, it is only one piece of the scientific puzzle. This part of the book explores how the same tools and techniques—sensors, measurements, data, and AI—can be applied across disciplines.

In chemistry, you’ll use color, temperature, and reaction rates to probe the molecular world. In biology and medicine, your smartphone becomes a tool for investigating physiology, plants, microbes, and health. Environmental physics helps you measure the world around you—rainfall, pressure, soil, light. And in information theory, you’ll uncover the hidden structures within sound waves, radio signals, and communication networks.

This part is where boundaries blur. It’s where science becomes interdisciplinary—and where you might find your own path into research, invention, or innovation. Whether you’re observing cell behavior, tracking air quality, or analyzing a song with Fourier transforms, the method remains the same: careful observation, thoughtful questioning, and playful experimentation.
