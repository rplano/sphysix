## Appendix D: Suggested Equipment

While the heart of Sphysix lies in creativity and minimalism, having a small collection of helpful tools and materials on hand can vastly expand the range and quality of experiments you can perform. Most of these are inexpensive, commonly available, or repurposed from everyday life.

This appendix outlines the kinds of items worth keeping in your “science drawer” — items that can be used across multiple chapters or in constructing new experiments of your own.

### Essential Tools

- **Tripod or Clamp Mount**: For stabilizing your phone during photography, measurements, or video analysis.
- **Smartphone Lens Attachments**: Macro lenses, telephoto adapters, or clip-on microscope lenses.
- **Flashlight or Laser Pointer**: For optics experiments, light measurements, or basic signal experiments.
- **Ruler, Measuring Tape, and Calipers**: For geometric measurements and calibration.
- **Protractor, Sextant App, or Physical Clinometer**: For angular measurements and astronomy work.

### Electronics & DIY Components

- **Breadboard and Jumper Wires**: For simple circuits that connect to audio jacks or USB interfaces.
- **Basic Resistors, Capacitors, and LEDs**: For voltage dividers, blinking indicators, and light-based sensors.
- **Piezoelectric Buzzer or Speaker**: Useful as both sound source and vibration sensor.
- **Photodiodes or Light Sensors**: For building simple optical experiments.
- **Op-Amps or Voltage-to-Frequency Converters**: For interfacing analog sensors with the microphone jack.
- **Audio Jack Breakout Cable**: To safely access the microphone and speaker contacts.

### Optics and Light

- **Polarization Filters**: Often sourced from old sunglasses or LCD screens; useful in many optics experiments.
- **Lenses and Prisms**: Repurposed from inexpensive magnifiers or kits.
- **Diffraction Gratings**: Available online or made from CDs or DVDs; used in spectroscopy.
- **Beamsplitter Glass or Calcit Crystal**: Optional, for more advanced optics setups.
- **Projection Screen or Parchment Paper**: For visualizing diffraction, shadows, and interference.

### Magnetism and Fields

- **Neodymium Magnets (various sizes)**: Strong, reusable magnets for magnetic field experiments.
- **Copper Pipe and Aluminum Sheets**: For electromagnetic braking, eddy current, and induction studies.
- **Wire Coils or Solenoids**: For simple electromagnetism experiments; can be homemade.
- **Nails and Graphite Mine**: Nails are useful for demonstrating temporary magnetism, while graphite (from a pencil mine) can be used in **diamagnetism** experiments to show weak repulsion from magnetic fields.

### Mechanics and Materials

- **Rubber Bands and Springs**: Essential for harmonic motion, elasticity, and energy transfer.
- **Masses or Weights**: Uniform objects like washers, coins, or nuts for repeatable measurements.
- **Elastic Thread, Fishing Line, or Torsion Wire**: For building pendulums or torsion balances.
- **Coins or Marbles**: For low-friction rolling and collision studies.
- **Putty / Modeling Clay**: For affixing objects, damping motion, or changing shapes.

### Chemistry & Biology

- **pH Test Strips or Water Quality Kits**: For colorimetric sensor experiments using the smartphone camera.
- **Heat-Resistant Containers**: For thermal and liquid-based experiments.
- **Simple Thermometer**: For comparison with infrared sensors or calibration.
- **Petri Dishes, Droppers, Pipettes**: For biology-related microscopy or fluid dynamics.
- **Paper Towels and Cardstock**: For capillary action and absorbance studies.

### Miscellaneous and Household

- **Zip-Lock Bags and Clear Plastic Wrap**: For waterproofing or creating controlled environments.
- **Aluminum Foil and Mirror Pieces**: For building reflectors, pinholes, and simple interferometers.
- **Clothes Hanger Wire or Construction Brackets**: Useful in building physical setups.
- **Sewing Needles, Pins, Razor Blades**: For precise alignment or creating slits.
- **Transparent Tape, Velcro, and Mounting Putty**: For quick prototyping and alignment.

### Where to Get Supplies

- **Electronics Kits**: Beginner kits often contain all basic components you need.
- **Hardware Stores**: Springs, fasteners, brackets, and pipes can all be found here.
- **Art or Craft Stores**: Lenses, clays, putties, and transparent materials.
- **Online Marketplaces**: Specialty optics, sensors, or educational kits are widely available and inexpensive.

This equipment list isn’t a requirement — it’s a palette. Start with the items you already have. As your interests grow, so will your personal collection of scientific tools, each one a stepping stone to new discoveries.
