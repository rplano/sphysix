## Appendix B: AI Prompt Library

This appendix is a curated collection of prompt templates designed to support and enrich your scientific exploration with AI — specifically using ChatGPT or similar tools. Prompts are organized by category and purpose. You are encouraged to adapt, remix, and experiment with them freely. The key is not to memorize these prompts but to understand how to ask clear, purposeful questions.

These examples assume you are working with a chatbot like ChatGPT, but the spirit of inquiry applies more broadly.


#### Data Analysis

Use these prompts to analyze sensor data collected during your experiments.

- "I recorded this data with my phone's accelerometer. Can you help me plot it and identify trends?"  
  _Paste your time series or upload a CSV file._

- "Here is a table of temperature vs. time from my experiment. Can you fit a curve and explain what it means?"

- "Using this dataset, can you estimate the average, maximum, and rate of change?"

- "What type of filter (low-pass, high-pass, etc.) should I use to clean up this noisy data?"


#### Graph Interpretation and Slope

Ideal for extracting meaning from visual data.

- "This is a distance-time graph from a motion experiment. Can you help me interpret the slope?"

- "Based on this graph, when was the object at rest or accelerating?"

- "Can you calculate the slope of this data and tell me what it means physically?"


#### Experimental Design Support

Useful when designing new experiments or modifying existing ones.

- "How can I use my phone's light sensor to measure absorption of different materials?"

- "I want to compare how different surfaces affect sound reflection. Can you help me design a fair test?"

- "What's a simple way to test Newton’s second law using my phone?"


#### Theory and Explanation

Great for reinforcing background knowledge or understanding new ideas.

- "Why does temperature affect resistance in a wire?"

- "Can you explain what a Fourier transform is, and how it helps in analyzing sound data?"

- "What's the difference between inertial and gravitational mass?"


#### Historical and Conceptual Inquiry

Use these prompts to investigate the people, ideas, and history behind the science.

- "How did Aristarchus first estimate the distance to the Sun?"

- "Who discovered the laws of motion, and what were their original experiments?"

- "Tell me about Einstein’s 'happiest thought' and its connection to gravity."


#### Troubleshooting and Technical Help

For when something doesn’t quite work.

- "I tried using my phone’s magnetometer but the values seem erratic. What could be wrong?"

- "My thermal camera won’t detect small temperature changes. Any tips?"

- "I want to measure sound intensity, but my phone’s microphone keeps clipping. What can I do?"


#### Creative Exploration

Prompts to extend or reimagine the experiment.

- "How could I turn this experiment into a citizen science project?"

- "What would happen if I repeated this experiment on Mars?"

- "How could I test the same principle using a completely different setup?"


#### Final Note

These prompts are just a beginning. As you grow more confident in both your experimental and AI-supported thinking, you’ll learn how to shape questions that are specific, productive, and inspiring. Science doesn’t start with an answer. It starts with a really good question.
