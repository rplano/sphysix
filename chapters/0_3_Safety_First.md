## Safety First

Curiosity and caution go hand in hand. While most of the experiments in this book are safe and suitable for home or classroom use, some involve tools, environments, or physical effects that require care and attention.

The smartphone itself is generally a robust and well-contained device, but when it becomes a measuring tool—interacting with magnets, water, heat, or movement—it enters unfamiliar territory. This book encourages creative experimentation, but always within the bounds of common sense and responsibility.

Here are a few principles to keep in mind:

### Protect Your Smartphone

This is not laboratory equipment. Your phone was not designed to be dropped, submerged, overheated, or placed in a strong magnetic field. Whenever possible, you may want to use an old phone. Some experiments suggest enclosing your phone in a zip-lock bag, taping it to a spinning surface, or bringing it near water, flame, or pressure. Proceed with care. When in doubt, protect the device—or reconsider the setup entirely.

### Understand the Risks

Magnets can pinch fingers and damage electronic components. The sun, especially when used in conjunction with lenses or even binoculars, can be extremely dangerous. Lasers, even low-powered ones, can harm eyes if misused. Heating elements, sharp tools, high voltages, or pressurized containers can be dangerous if handled casually. Know what you’re doing before you begin, and never attempt an experiment unless you understand all the steps involved.

### Use the Right Environment

Some experiments are best done outside (e.g., those involving motion, height, or sound). Others require a dark room, still air, or a heat-proof surface. Be aware of your surroundings. Avoid busy kitchens, cluttered desks, or surfaces where materials might fall or break.

### Ask for Help

If you’re unsure about an experiment, ask a teacher, parent, or knowledgeable friend. Physics is about learning—not taking unnecessary risks. Collaboration and communication are part of the scientific process.

### Supervise Younger Students

Some activities are not appropriate for unsupervised children, especially those involving lasers, heat, or chemicals. If this book is being used with younger learners, adult guidance is essential.

### Treat Materials with Respect

Some of the experiments involve inexpensive electronics, magnets, optical lenses, or improvised materials. Even when using “junk” parts, treat your materials with care. Improvised science is not careless science.

Finally, remember: no experiment is so important that it cannot be paused, revised, or postponed in the name of safety.

Physics is powerful—and so is good judgment.
