# Part III: Core Physics Experiments

This part of the book is the heart of the *Sphysix* project. It gathers the foundational disciplines of physics — from motion and forces to light, heat, electricity, and beyond — and reimagines them through the lens of modern, sensor-equipped smartphones.

Each chapter explores a traditional area of physics, but the approach is entirely contemporary. Instead of relying solely on textbook derivations, students are invited to measure, visualize, and experiment. A drop of water becomes a lens, a subway ride becomes an accelerometer trace, and the flash of a smartphone illuminates thermodynamics. Through these carefully curated activities, readers can explore classical mechanics, wave phenomena, electromagnetism, astronomy, and even radioactivity and quantum ideas — directly, tangibly, and often in unexpected ways.

While this section builds on centuries of scientific discovery, it is structured to remove barriers to entry. Many experiments can be performed without a lab, often using nothing more than a mobile phone and household objects. Others combine classical intuition with modern tools like AI-assisted analysis or digital imaging. Together, these chapters emphasize that physics is not just a collection of formulas but a way of asking questions and investigating the world.

Whether you are building an interferometer on a kitchen table, capturing cosmic movement with astrophotography, or tracking the decay of a radioactive seed with your camera sensor, this part of the book will show how physics — rooted in simplicity and curiosity — can come alive in your hands.
