## Mechanics & Motion

From the swing of a pendulum to the flight of a rubber band, mechanics is all around us. It is the physics of motion and force — the foundation of how things move, why they fall, and what keeps them in place. In this chapter, we’ll explore motion through smartphone sensors like the accelerometer and gyroscope, investigate Newton’s laws with simple setups, and experiment with concepts like friction, momentum, and oscillation. Many of the experiments here require little more than your smartphone and curiosity, but they open the door to understanding the principles that govern everything from the smallest falling pebble to the largest planetary orbit.

Mechanics is the branch of physics that studies how things move and the forces that cause those movements. From falling apples to orbiting moons, it’s the foundation of nearly every physical phenomenon. What makes it especially suitable for exploration with smartphones is that motion and force leave measurable traces: vibrations, accelerations, positions, velocities — all of which modern devices are equipped to record.

### Measuring Acceleration with Free Fall (MECH-01)

**Sensors Used:** Accelerometer  
**What’s Measured:** Vertical acceleration during free fall

**Description:**  
Drop your smartphone gently onto a soft surface — or better yet, let it fall inside a *safe enclosure* such as a padded box or sling. Use a sensor app to record **accelerometer data** during the fall. If done correctly, you'll see a short period where the phone registers near-zero acceleration — a brief moment of **true free fall**.

This simple experiment vividly demonstrates the concept of **apparent weightlessness**, just like what astronauts experience in orbit.

### Measuring Gravitational Acceleration with Video and Multiflash Photography (MECH-02)

**Sensors Used:** Camera (video), flashlight (strobe mode)  
**What’s Measured:** Acceleration over time, time of fall

**Description:**  
This experiment demonstrates how to measure the acceleration due to gravity (*g*) using two different visual techniques. In both methods, a falling object is recorded, and its motion is analyzed to extract position, time, and acceleration data.

**Method 1 – High-Speed Video Analysis:**  
Drop a small object (like a ball) in front of a smartphone camera recording at high frame rate. Use frame-by-frame analysis to measure the object’s vertical displacement over time. Plotting position vs. time allows for determination of *g* using the equation of motion.

**Method 2 – Multiflash (Strobe) Photography:**  
Use a smartphone app with a flashing light or an external strobe while a second camera captures a long-exposure photo of the object’s fall. Each flash illuminates the object’s position at fixed intervals, creating a sequence of bright spots. The increasing spacing between flashes visually shows constant acceleration.  
Students can measure distances between dots and apply kinematic equations to calculate *g*.

### Inclined Plane (MECH-03)

**Sensors Used:** Accelerometer  
**What’s Measured:** Acceleration as a function of incline angle; acceleration profiles during motion

**Description:**  
Roll your phone (or a toy car with the phone on it) down a smooth inclined plane. Record the acceleration and calculate how it changes with the steepness of the slope. This experiment makes it easy to explore trigonometry in physics — using *a = g·sin(θ)* to relate angle and acceleration.

**Alternative:**  
Place your phone on a skateboard, rolling toy, or simple cart, and push it gently on flat ground and on a slight incline. Use the accelerometer to measure acceleration profiles and compare distances covered over time. This lets students analyze friction, net forces, and kinetic energy without fancy lab setups.

### Jumping, Walking, Running, and Biking Acceleration (MECH-04)

**Sensors Used:** Accelerometer  
**What’s Measured:** Acceleration patterns during jumping, walking, running, and biking; airtime; step frequency; stride dynamics

**Description:**  
Hold the phone while jumping vertically (on a soft surface). The accelerometer will show a spike during takeoff, a flat section near zero during midair (free fall), and a strong jolt on landing. You can measure the airtime and use it to estimate the jump height — a cool combination of biomechanics, motion, and energy.

Or hold your phone or wear it while walking, running, or biking. The accelerometer will show regular pulses — a direct measurement of the biomechanics of motion. You can estimate stride length, step frequency, or even design your own DIY pedometer.
