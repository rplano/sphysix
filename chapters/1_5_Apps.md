## Apps and Tools: What to Install

To unlock the full experimental potential of your smartphone, a few well-chosen apps are essential. This section provides a curated selection of free or low-cost tools that allow access to sensor data, aid in data collection and analysis, and even bring in the capabilities of artificial intelligence when needed. The focus is on accessibility, reliability, and educational value—nothing proprietary, nothing bloated, just what you need to get started.

### Core Sensor Apps

Several apps provide direct access to your phone’s built-in sensors. These allow you to record data from the accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, barometer, light sensor, and more. The most robust and widely used include:

- **phyphox** — Developed by RWTH Aachen University, this app is the gold standard for physics sensor experiments. It allows detailed control and real-time graphing of data from nearly all common smartphone sensors. Exporting data as CSV for further analysis is seamless.

- **Physics Toolbox Sensor Suite** — Offers a broad array of sensor access with a simple interface. Very useful for quickly viewing and recording real-time data.

- **Sensor Kinetics** — Designed with diagnostics in mind, this app helps you explore sensor performance and limitations, making it useful for comparative experiments.

### Camera and Imaging Apps

Many experiments involve visual data—whether it's capturing trajectories, analyzing brightness, or documenting experimental setups.

- **Open Camera** — A powerful and open-source camera app for Android that allows full manual control over ISO, exposure time, and focus. Ideal for astrophotography, long-exposure shots, and image-based measurements.

- **Light Meter Apps** — A variety of apps are available to turn your phone into a basic lux meter using the ambient light sensor. While not precise scientific instruments, they are good enough for comparative studies.

- **Tracker Video Analysis (PC)** — For more advanced motion analysis, video frames can be exported to a computer for use with tools like Tracker or Vernier’s video analysis platforms.

### Astronomy and Orientation Tools

For experiments involving Earth’s rotation, celestial navigation, or measuring angles in the night sky, the following apps are particularly useful:

- **Sextant or Clinometer Apps** — These tools help measure elevation angles, such as the altitude of Polaris or the angle of the Sun at noon.

- **Sky Map** — Helps locate celestial objects and identify stars, planets, and constellations in real time.

- **Stellarium or Heavens Above** — Great for planning observations and tracking satellite positions.

### Math and Data Analysis Tools

As experimental data grows in complexity, so too does the need for analysis. The following tools can help with graphing, regression analysis, and mathematical modeling:

- **Desmos** and **GeoGebra** — These apps are excellent for graphing functions, solving equations, and visualizing data relationships.

- **Spreadsheet Tools** — Whether you prefer Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or LibreOffice Calc, a spreadsheet remains a versatile companion for data analysis.

- **ChatGPT** — As demonstrated throughout this book, a modern AI assistant can help interpret data, derive formulas, plot graphs, and even offer creative experiment ideas. Simply paste your data into the prompt, describe what you're trying to do, and see where the conversation leads.

### Advanced and Specialized Tools

Depending on your device, additional sensors and features may be available:

- **Thermal Imaging Apps** — For phones equipped with infrared cameras (such as the CAT S60 or FLIR-equipped models), these apps allow for powerful thermal visualization in experiments involving heat flow or infrared absorption.

- **Spectrometer Tools** — With a DIY diffraction grating and the right app, your camera can become a basic spectrometer, enabling experiments in light composition and emission spectra.

- **Sound Spectrum Analyzers** — Apps that display real-time frequency information are helpful in resonance, harmonics, and Doppler effect studies.

### Final Note

Before diving into experiments, take a few minutes to explore what your phone can already do. Install a few of the recommended apps, open the sensor viewers, and move your device around. You may be surprised how much physics your phone is already measuring—all you need is the curiosity to ask questions, and the tools to look a little closer.
