# Biology

Biology is often seen as a "soft" science—more about observation than measurement. But in truth, it's full of motion, cycles, energy, and structure—all of which can be captured and quantified using the sensors in a smartphone.

This chapter turns living systems into living data: from the tilt of a growing stem to the bubbles of fermenting yeast, from the tiny mouths of a leaf to the swirling microbes in a drop of pond water. With just a camera, a light sensor, or a clip-on microscope, students can explore growth, metabolism, communication, reproduction, and even how plants respond to stress.

Some experiments are classics—reimagined through a modern lens. Others use AI-powered tools for identification, analysis, or explanation. But all share the same spirit: low-cost, ethically clean, and powered by curiosity, careful observation, and wonder.

These bubbles offer tangible, visual proof that photosynthesis is actively converting light into chemical energy. For added depth, a light sensor app can help correlate light intensity with observed activity. Whether through motion or gas release, this experiment reveals the living mechanics of photosynthesis in a way that's accessible, beautiful, and grounded in everyday observation.


### The Sweating Leaf: Measuring Transpiration with a Plastic Bag (BIO-14)

**Sensors Used:** Camera (time-lapse), optional humidity or temperature sensor  
**What's Measured:** Water vapor release (transpiration rate)

**Description**  
Though seemingly still, plants are constantly at work moving water through their tissues and into the air. This process, known as transpiration, becomes visible in this simple and revealing experiment. By enclosing one or more healthy leaves in a clear plastic bag and gently sealing it around the stem, students can watch moisture accumulate on the inside of the bag over the course of a few hours. The condensation that forms is water vapor released from the plant through stomata—tiny pores that control both gas exchange and water loss.**

Students can enhance the investigation by capturing time-lapse images to document the progression of condensation, weighing any water that collects as droplets, or using smartphone-based humidity or temperature sensors to explore how environmental conditions affect transpiration. This elegant setup offers a hands-on look at plant physiology and environmental interaction, helping students understand how plants regulate moisture and contribute to larger ecological cycles—one invisible breath at a time.


### Measuring Green: Estimating Leaf Surface Area with a Camera (BIO-15)

**Sensors Used:** Camera  
**What's Measured:** Leaf surface area (as a proxy for photosynthetic potential)

The surface of a leaf is where light meets life—capturing sunlight, exchanging gases, and fueling photosynthesis. In this experiment, students use a smartphone camera to estimate the surface area of a leaf, turning a simple image into a data-rich window into plant function and adaptation. To begin, a leaf is placed flat on graph paper or millimeter paper, then photographed from above under even lighting and with minimal distortion.**

Using image analysis software—or by uploading the photo to ChatGPT for help—students can count the number of pixels within the leaf's outline, compare it to the grid, and convert that count into real-world measurements. This process transforms a flat photo into a biological dataset. By comparing leaf sizes across different species or between plants grown in sun versus shade, or dry versus humid conditions, students uncover how leaf morphology reflects environmental pressures and photosynthetic needs. It's a hands-on experiment that merges plant biology with image analysis, showing how simple observations can yield deep ecological insight.


### Detecting Photosynthesis via CO₂ Reduction in a Closed Environment (BIO-16)

**Sensors Used:** CO₂ sensor (Bluetooth or USB), smartphone for logging  
**What's Measured:** Changes in CO₂ concentration under light vs. dark conditions

**Description**  
Photosynthesis is more than a response to light—it's a transformation of the atmosphere, as plants pull carbon dioxide from the air to fuel their growth. In this experiment, students make that invisible exchange visible by placing a small plant or leaf in a transparent, airtight bag along with a portable CO₂ sensor. As the plant photosynthesizes in sunlight, it absorbs CO₂, causing the concentration inside the bag to drop. When the plant is kept in darkness, photosynthesis stops, and respiration takes over—releasing CO₂ back into the space and reversing the trend.**

Students can log changes in carbon dioxide using a Bluetooth- or USB-connected sensor and track differences between light and dark conditions in real time. This setup offers a powerful, data-driven view of plant metabolism, highlighting the balance between carbon capture and release. What's usually invisible in the air becomes a measurable signal of life's quiet chemistry.


### Using pH Indicators to Detect Photosynthesis in Water Plants (BIO-17)

**Sensors Used:** Camera, optional color analysis app  
**What's Measured:** pH change as an indicator of CO₂ uptake during photosynthesis

**Description**  
Photosynthesis doesn't just transform light into energy—it also subtly alters the chemistry of the water around aquatic plants. In this experiment, students use a pH-sensitive dye, such as bromothymol blue, to visualize these changes. When submerged in water with Elodea or a similar aquatic plant, the dye acts as a real-time reporter of CO₂ levels. As the plant photosynthesizes in the presence of light, it removes carbon dioxide from the water, making it less acidic and causing the dye to shift toward blue. In the absence of light, respiration dominates, CO₂ is released, and the solution becomes more acidic, turning greener or yellow.**

Students can document the color shifts using a smartphone camera and optionally analyze the images with a color analysis app to quantify the changes in hue or RGB values. This vivid, accessible experiment offers a clear connection between plant activity and chemical feedback—making the invisible dance of gas exchange suddenly visible in a glass of colored water.


### Using a Thermal Camera to Compare Active and Inactive Photosynthesis (BIO-18)

**Sensors Used:** Thermal camera  
**What's Measured:** Surface temperature differences due to transpiration and photosynthetic activity

**Description**  
Photosynthesis cools plants—not metaphorically, but physically. In this experiment, students use a smartphone equipped with a thermal camera (such as the CAT S60) to compare the surface temperatures of two similar plants placed side by side: one exposed to direct sunlight and the other kept in shade. Active photosynthesis triggers the opening of stomata, allowing for transpiration—the release of water vapor—which results in a slight but measurable cooling effect. By capturing thermal images of both plants simultaneously, students can detect these subtle differences in temperature. This hands-on investigation introduces key concepts in plant physiology, linking photosynthetic activity, stomatal behavior, and heat regulation in a way that makes these processes visible and measurable.**

**Sensors Used:** Temperature sensor or infrared (IR) camera  
**What's Measured:** Cooling rate of living vs. non-living material

**Description**  
Living things manage energy in subtle, powerful ways—and this experiment reveals just how different they are from inanimate objects. Students compare the cooling behavior of a fresh leaf and a piece of paper after both are gently warmed under a lamp or near a warm surface. Using a smartphone equipped with a temperature sensor or thermal camera, they track how quickly each material loses heat. The results are striking: the leaf tends to stay warm longer, thanks to its higher water content and, potentially, the lingering effects of its metabolic processes. This simple comparison illustrates concepts like thermal inertia and water retention while hinting at deeper biological ideas such as homeostasis. It's a compelling fusion of biology and physics, showing that even after the heat is gone, life leaves its thermal fingerprint.**

Fermentation doesn't just create bubbles—it gives off heat. As yeast metabolize sugar, they release energy in the form of warmth, making this a tangible example of an exothermic biological process. In this experiment, students set up two flasks: one containing live yeast and sugar to initiate fermentation, and another serving as a control with either boiled yeast or no sugar at all. Using a smartphone-compatible temperature probe or a thermal camera like the CAT S60, students measure the rise in temperature over time. The difference in thermal output between the active and control setups makes the metabolic activity of the yeast visible in real time. This hands-on demonstration links energy conversion, thermodynamics, and biological processes, turning a warm flask into living evidence of cellular respiration.**


### Tracking the Buzz: Estimating Alcohol Production from Fermentation (BIO-25)

**Sensors Used:** Digital scale, optional pressure sensor  
**What's Measured:** CO₂ production as a proxy for ethanol yield

**Description**  
Fermentation is famous for its fizz, but behind those bubbles lies a chemical transformation that also produces ethanol. Since tasting isn't an option in the classroom, this experiment takes an indirect route—using mass and gas to estimate alcohol production. Students set up a sealed fermentation vessel containing yeast, warm water, and sugar, and place it on a digital kitchen scale. As the yeast break down the sugar, they release carbon dioxide, which escapes the container and causes a gradual loss in mass. Because CO₂ and ethanol are produced in a 1:1 molar ratio during alcoholic fermentation, students can use the recorded weight loss to estimate how much ethanol has been generated. Alternatively, gas volume can be tracked with a balloon or measured using a pressure sensor. This clever approach transforms invisible chemical changes into measurable data and offers a hands-on application of stoichiometry, metabolism, and energy balance.**


### Seeing Cells Grow: Measuring Turbidity with a Smartphone (BIO-26)

### Can Plants Scream? Measuring Voltage and Sound Responses to Stress (BIO-32)

**Sensors Used:** Microphone input (for voltage monitoring), ultrasonic microphone (optional)  
**What's Measured:** Electrical signals and ultrasonic emissions from stressed plants

**Description**  
It may sound like science fiction, but plants under stress can emit detectable electrical and acoustic signals—faint, measurable echoes of their inner state. In this experiment, students investigate whether plants "scream" by exploring two different methods of stress detection. The first involves measuring electrical signals: by attaching simple electrodes, such as foil clips or conductive pads, to a plant's stem or leaves, students can record rapid voltage shifts when the plant is touched, cut, or begins to dry out. These tiny pulses, amplified through a basic op-amp circuit and fed into a smartphone's microphone input, become visible through an oscilloscope app—offering a glimpse into plant bioelectricity.**

The second approach focuses on sound, specifically ultrasonic emissions. Some research suggests that plants experiencing drought emit high-frequency clicks caused by cavitation events in the xylem. Using a USB ultrasonic microphone and a frequency analysis app, students can attempt to capture these acoustic signals. Even without ultrasonic tools, a standard smartphone microphone may pick up low-frequency vibrations or other sound changes under stress.

Both approaches raise compelling biological questions: Do all species emit similar signals? Can stress be detected before visual symptoms appear? Could this represent a form of plant communication—or even a primitive nervous system? This experiment turns abstract scientific headlines into something students can test for themselves, blending electronics, acoustics, and plant physiology into a truly interdisciplinary exploration.

### Cameras and Creatures: Observing Animal Motion and Behavior (BIO-33)

**Sensors Used:** Camera  
**What's Measured:** Animal movement, foraging behavior, response to stimuli

**Description**  
Animal behavior is biology in motion—subtle, dynamic, and full of meaning. With just a smartphone camera, students can explore the ways creatures move, respond, and interact with their surroundings. This experiment invites observation of everything from the winding path of an ant to the eager reactions of a household pet. Whether in a controlled setting or a natural environment, students can record video footage of animals as they forage, explore, or respond to changes. By using basic video analysis tools, they can measure speed, track movement patterns, and even construct simple maps of foraging paths or obstacle navigation.**

To explore behavioral responses more deeply, students might introduce a stimulus such as food or light at varying distances or angles, then observe how the animal alters its approach. Does it choose the shortest path? Hesitate in low light? These everyday observations become entry points into the study of ethology and sensory biology, raising questions about perception, decision-making, and adaptation. With nothing more than a phone and patience, the rich language of animal behavior becomes visible, measurable, and full of insight.


### Echoes of the Wild: Analyzing Birdsong and Insect Calls (BIO-34)

**Sensors Used:** Microphone  
**What's Measured:** Frequency patterns, species-specific calls, bioacoustic variation

**Description**  
Nature hums with hidden messages—trills, chirps, croaks, and clicks that fill the air with meaning. This experiment brings students into the world of bioacoustics, where sound becomes a language to study and decode. With just a smartphone and a sound analysis app, students can record the calls of birds at dawn, crickets at dusk, or frogs along a pond's edge. These recordings, once loaded into a spectrogram or FFT visualization tool, reveal intricate frequency patterns, rhythms, and structures that often differ between species—and sometimes even between individuals.**

By comparing recordings made at different times of day, in various weather conditions, or in quiet versus noisy environments, students can observe how animal communication shifts in response to ecological and social pressures. Beyond appreciating the beauty of birdsong, this experiment dives into the science of how animals use sound for territory defense, mating, alarm, and navigation. It's a gentle but powerful entry into wildlife monitoring, acoustic ecology, and the universal importance of voice in the natural world.
